Greenhouse Gases Are the Main Reasons for Global Warming<br>
Although carbon dioxide receives the most press as the culprit responsible for global warming, 
water vapor is actually the most abundant greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide still
 deserves its notoriety, however. It may be a minor component of the atmosphere, but its increased 
abundance is contributing to the warming trend, according to NASA. Humans exacerbate the problem by
 cutting trees that absorb this gas and by adding other greenhouse gases to the mixture over and above
 those that enter through natural processes. In addition, one of the global warming causes might be astronomical.<br><br>

Cause #1: Variations in the Sun's Intensity<br>
The Earth receives its warmth from the sun, so it's reasonable to suspect that our home star may be one of
 the reasons for global warming. Although the amount of energy coming from the sun does vary and may have
 been responsible for warming in the past, however, NASA and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC) have ruled this out as a cause of the current warming trend. The average energy coming from the sun
 generally has remained constant since 1750, and the warming does not occur uniformly throughout the atmosphere.
 The upper layer is actually cooling as the bottom layer becomes warmer.<br><br>

Cause #2: Industrial Activity<br>

Since the Industrial Revolution, humans have been burning fossil fuels such as coal and petroleum for energy, 
which releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. A quarter of this is for heat and electricity, while another 
quarter is for other industrial processes and transportation, which includes gasoline- or diesel-powered cars, trucks,
 trains and airplanes. The other half of the energy is used for various other purposes, including agriculture,
 cement production and oil and gas production. These processes also release other greenhouse gases, such as methane
 and CFCs, although the concentration of CFCs has declined since their use was banned in 1988.<br><br>

Cause #3: Agricultural Activity<br>
The agricultural practices that produce food for the people on earth is another of the human causes of climate change.
 The use of both commercial and organic fertilizers releases nitrous oxide, a powerful greenhouse gas. Methane, another 
important greenhouse gas, comes from many natural sources, but also from the digestive systems of livestock raised for
 meat production as well as the decomposition of waste in landfills and the burning of biomass.<br><br>

Cause #4: Deforestation<br>
The increased demand for meat and dairy cattle has lead to the creation of feed lots in otherwise forested areas. 
Logging for wood and paper and clearing for crop production also requires trees to be cut, sometimes illegally. One
 mature tree absorbs as much as 48 pounds of carbon dioxide each year, and by one estimate, 3.5 to 7 billion are cut 
every year. According to Scientific American, deforestation is responsible for 15 percent of the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.<br><br>

Cause #5: Earth's Own Feedback Loop<br>
As the atmosphere warms, it is able to hold more water, which is already the most abundant greenhouse gas. This creates 
a feedback loop that accelerates global warming. It also creates more clouds, rainstorms and other symptoms of climate 
change. At the poles, the warming of the atmosphere melts the ice cover, exposing water, which is less reflective than ice.
 The water absorbs the sun's heat, and the oceans also become warmer as a result.<br><br>
Global warming occurs when carbon dioxide (CO2) and other air pollutants and greenhouse gases collect in the atmosphere 
and absorb sunlight and solar radiation that have bounced off the earth’s surface. Normally, this radiation would escape
 into space—but these pollutants, which can last for years to centuries in the atmosphere, trap the heat and cause the planet 
to get hotter. That's what's known as the greenhouse effect.<br><br>
In the United States, the burning of fossil fuels to make electricity is the largest source of heat-trapping pollution, producing
 about two billion tons of CO2 every year. Coal-burning power plants are by far the biggest polluters. The country’s second-largest
 source of carbon pollution is the transportation sector, which generates about 1.7 billion tons of CO2 emissions a year.<br><br> 
Curbing dangerous climate change requires very deep cuts in emissions, as well as the use of alternatives to fossil fuels worldwide.
 The good news is that we’ve started a turnaround: CO2 emissions in the United States actually decreased from 2005 to 2014, thanks in
 part to new, energy-efficient technology and the use of cleaner fuels. And scientists continue to develop new ways to modernize power
 plants, generate cleaner electricity, and burn less gasoline while we drive. The challenge is to be sure these solutions are put to use 
and widely adopted.<br><br>
